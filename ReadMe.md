# Project

This is an API project I'm working on that utilizes the Google Autocomplete API to take part of an address, city through zipcode, and returns the top choice.

## Notes

The Google_API_PyQuest module is ignored in this as it contains my personal Google API Key code. The api_request() module simply returns a Google API Key; you can remove the PyQuest import and have API_Key = [Your Google API Key]
